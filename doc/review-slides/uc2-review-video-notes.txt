* First explain service details only with PPT. Don't start video yet
* Then start video with "Demo time!"-Slide (1:40 of current video)
* Normal production: Machine data arrives in normal NS1 as it should
* Intrusion attempt:
	* Assume hacker got IP address and already has access to the network
	* Finds open Samba ports at IP address and connects to Samba share
	* Could now read or write data on that Samba share
* Intrusion detection: IDS notices intrusion, shows in Kibana dashboard
* Aler triggered:
	* Directly sends intrusion alert on monitoring system
	* Policy --> installed monitoring rule --> fires --> triggers policy action & reconfiguration
* Reconfiguration: Machine keeps sending data, but stops arriving in normal NS1 & starts arriving in NS1-q
* Threat contained!
